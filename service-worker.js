It closes the gap between a hacker house (super small, long time period) and a conference, and enables more depth, personal connection and exchange through co-living and not being constrained by time as much as with a usual conference. This combined with bringing together different fields of technological innovation and coordination (Distributed Systems, Cryptography, AI, Neuroscience, etc.) creates a unique environment where unforeseen novel ideas and concepts can emerge and flourish.
